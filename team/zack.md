# Introduction
Hi I'm Zack! I'm a second year Computer Science Major. I just changed into the major last quarter so this is my first upper division CS course. My hobbies include: building computers, working on cars, and playing with my dog Mia. I look forward to expanding my coding experience!

# About the Project
Our file transfer program will work similar to Apple's AirDrop but will be compatible with all devices. The files will only be able to be transfered between devices on the same local network. The program will not run in the background but will only work when both devices intiate a transfer.
