My main contributions to the project were helping implement host uploads, mobile downloads, building the Loft binary executable
for Mac devices, and maintaining user manual and instruction documentation. 
- For host uploads, I worked on the native PyQt GUI, and collaborated with Andrew who worked on server-side components. 
- For mobile downloads, I collaborated extensively with Zack to coordinate back-end communication between host and client.
- Due to commit squashing/pair programming, a lot of work done regarding these two issues was not reflected in the contributions log.
- Building the Mac binary was an individual effort that encompassed a lot of challenges with Python packaging module `cx-Freeze`
  and compatibility challenges with other Mac devices.
- Writing the user manual, meeting notes, instructions, etc is pretty straightforward.
