`The contributors section is highly innaccurate for my case because I was unfamiliar with Github and our tech stack for a lot of the quarter so my group took care of the commits while I learned from and worked with them.`
- Implemented the IP address function with Andrew so that our program could display the host's IP address to give a link for the user to follow
- Worked with Douglas to get the download functionality from host to client working, Douglas worked on the frontend while I worked on the backend
- Was in charge of packaging for Windows using pyinstaller while Andrew worked on packaging for Linux and Douglas worked on packaging for Mac
- Noticed an issue with our program being slow on windows so I worked to get it fixed, however, Ethan addded server threading in a future commmit which served as a fix for it.
- Setup the https toggle feature with Ethan.
- Before code freeze I worked to try and get the packaging working again for windows because the https feature broke it, however, Ethan and I were unable to fix it but Ethan was able to package with Windows by disabling https
