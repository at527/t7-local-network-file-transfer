We’ve mostly been squash-and-merging PRs, so the total number of commits is relatively small 
compared to the total number of actual commits. Also, at least three PRs were merged directly 
into main by accident, which then contain the true number of intermediate commits from that
branch. Finally, we’ve been making changes to the documentation (_i.e._ user manual, meeting
notes, and the README) in commits directly to main, which also artificially inflates the
total number of commits.

I was responsible for the general architecture of the application, the web client UI, and
the REST API exposed by the Flask server; as well as continuous integration testing of that
API.
