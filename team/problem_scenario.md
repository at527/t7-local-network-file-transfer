# Problem Scenario

Andrew is working on an assignment on his iPad and needs to transfer a file to his Linux laptop. 
He does not have a USB cable. His internet connection is too slow to upload to something like Google Drive.

He has access to a wireless network though.
What if there was a way to transfer files wirelessly without uploading to "the cloud."
