# Me

Hello everyone, my name is Kevin. I am a third year CS major. I switched into this major from Electrical Engineering during my second year. A couple of my interests outside of school are anime, basketball, and selling sneakers.

# Ideas

The idea of the project is to allow devices on the same local network to transfer files in a similar fashion to Airdrop. I don't have enough knowledge about this topic to speak technically, but I'm thinking this could be done through the devices logging on to the web app on the same network. The app could display all the devices connected to the app and allow some drag-and-drop action similar to Airdrop.

# Norms

- Make sure everyone is comfortable working / talking to each other.
- Treat everyone with respect.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions.
