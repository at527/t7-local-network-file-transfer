# Me

Hello everyone, my name is Kevin. I am a third year CS major. I switched into this major from Electrical Engineering during my second year. A couple of my interests outside of school are anime, basketball, and selling sneakers. I look forward to working with everyone and learning about how to create an app.

# Ideas

The idea of the project is to allow devices on the same local network to transfer files in a similar fashion to Airdrop. The project will be an app where you can drag files onto it after opening, it is not an app that continuously runs in the background.

# Norms

- Make sure everyone is comfortable working / talking to each other.
- Treat everyone with respect.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions.
