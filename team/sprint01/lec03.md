Andrew did some research and set up a file sharing server with Python. The server is able to upload and download. He discovered that a mobile app may not be required. The project will most likely be implemented by a web client. One concern is how the app would work on Eduroam. Python web server. Our backend will most likely use Flask if we need one and the front end will be created with React.
