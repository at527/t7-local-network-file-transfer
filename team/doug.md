# Me

Hey team! My name is Douglas, but you can call me Doug. I'm a third-year CS major, but I've switched majors many times before CS (geography, econ, actuarial science). I'm currently living at home in San Francisco. Go dubs. Excited to learn new stuff and have a good quarter with y'all!

# Ideas

The idea of the project is to allow devices on the same local network to transfer files in a similar fashion to Airdrop. I don't have enough knowledge about this topic to speak technically, but I'm envisioning this could be done through the devices logging on to the web app on the same network. The app could display all the connected to the app and allow some drag-and-drop action similar to Airdrop.

# Norms

- Make sure everyone is comfortable working / talking to each other.
- Always keep track of the individual and team progress.
- Ask for help when you get stuck.
- Include necessary comments in code and write good commit messages.
