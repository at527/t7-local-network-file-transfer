## About Me ##
Hello! My name’s Ethan, and I’m a second-year CS major/music minor. I play the
piano (okay), marimba (decently well), and concert percussion (very badly). This
is my first time programming in a team setting, so I’m excited to work with
everyone!

## Project Ideas ##
For the file-transfer application, I am imagining two separate applications: one
for PC and one for mobile. The PC application is opened first, and establishes a
local HTTP server, to which the mobile application connects to and then can
upload to/download from. The mobile application can discover the server using a
QR code displayed on the PC application. Security features can be added later,
like making the code a one-time use item.

## Norms etc. ##
Since Andrew’s already brought up some excellent points I guess I’ll bring up
some less important things that we need to do?
- Squash commits to make the commit log easier to read.
- Comment thoroughly whenever possible, because deciphering uncommented code is
  painful.
- ~~_Accept that tabs are dead and spaces rule supreme._~~ Use an automatic
  formatter to maximize readability and minimize time wasted on formatting.
